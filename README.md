###To run the generator you can use the following command:

python3.8 generator/grid.py size

(this will invoke either the random or the procedural generator)

###To run the solver you can use the following command:

python3.8 solver/run_solver.py -f filename

The file should just contain a grid and nothing else. 
You can find examples in the /levels directory.
